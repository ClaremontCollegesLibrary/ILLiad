# ILLiad
ILLiad files with custom javascript.  Repository created to make file sharing easier.

Five ILLiad request forms that contain custom javascript.  In brief:

LoanRequest.html
LoanRequest-Faculty.html
LoanRequest-Staff.html
OtherRequest.html
OtherRequest-Faculty.html

ItemInfo1 is used to gather "purpose" info.  The javascript concatenates/joins the checked off values into one hidden box that goes into the ILLiad request.  Up until a month ago I'd left the "String" box visible and found people were adding their own narrative for why they were making their request.

OtherRequest.html
OtherRequest-Faculty.html

ItemInfo2 is used to identify what is being requested.  Depending on the patron's initial drop down menu choice, javascript produces additional drop down lists of further choices.

LoanRequest.html
LoanRequest-Faculty.html
LoanRequest-Staff.html
OtherRequest.html
OtherRequest-Faculty.html

ItemInfo3 had been used to ask if an ebook would be accepted, but we stopped using it.  I don't remember why.

ItemInfo4 & ItemInfo5 not used in any ILLiad forms.
